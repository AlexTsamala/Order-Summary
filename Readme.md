## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- div
- button
- hover
- background-picture




### What I learned

I learned how to use flex-box  ,how to add background picture ,how to use button and also hover.

```html
<button class="cool">Some HTML code I'm proud of</button>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image:
}
```

### Continued development

Now i want to focus on css also want to improve myself on positioning elements.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to learn syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Html css flex-box. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
